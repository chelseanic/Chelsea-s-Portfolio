        <p>Hey! My name is Chelsea Castillo. I was born and raised in New York.</p>

      <p>I am very interested in drawing and have been since I was kid. I've also been watching cartoons and anime shows for just as long. Some of my favorites are Teen Titans, Death Note and Sailor moon.
        <br> <br> 
        I enjoy video games as well. Some of my favorites are the old Tomb Raider games, the Grand Theft Auto series, Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, and more. I really love to draw characters from the video games I've played. Some of the characters I've drawn are Lara Croft, Spiderman, and a zombie from Plants vs. Zombies.
        <br> <br> 
        I'm hoping to become an animator in the future. I am open to exploring other things in the field of film and media alongside as well.</p>
